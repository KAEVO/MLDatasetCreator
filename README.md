# MLDatasetCreator\nA Golang tool that provides efficient creation of Machine Learning Datasets from public Social Network APIs. Its main function is to manage concurrent operations and save data, offering a user-friendly and intuitive API.\n\n## Overview\nSocial APIs are frequently used for creating datasets for training Machine Learning models. For instance, models like [Tweet2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07514) aim to extract features or create embeddings from such data.\n\nMany models, particularly NLP-oriented ones, can benefit from a large repository of structured text that may or may not carry labeling.\n\nOften, creating such datasets takes time away from feature engineering and model formulation work. This tool aims to simplify the process.\n\nAlthough the autho
